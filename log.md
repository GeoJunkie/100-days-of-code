# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first day of my [Advent of Code calendar](https://adventofcode.com/)

**Thoughts**: I'm using JavaScript to hone my skills. At the same time, I'm working through the Full Stack JavaScript track at Team Treehouse, which will take up all of my other coding hours for a while :)
