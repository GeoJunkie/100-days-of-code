# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first day of my [Advent of Code calendar](https://adventofcode.com/)

**Thoughts**: I'm using JavaScript to hone my skills. At the same time, I'm working through the Full Stack JavaScript track at Team Treehouse, which will take up all of my other coding hours for a while :)

### Day 2: December 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the second day of my [Advent of Code calendar](https://adventofcode.com/)

**Thoughts**: I ran into trouble with part 2, because I failed to read the problem correctly. After spending a while agonizing over traces, data, and console.log entries, I started asking folks for ideas. Just describing the problem let me break my train of thought long enough to realize that I had read part of the description as a range of positions, but it was actually just two positions.

Careful understanding of the problem: the first step to solving it!

### Day 3: December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the third day of my [Advent of Code calendar](https://adventofcode.com/)

**Thoughts**: This one was fun. Mainly just a brute force loop through a list. For this, I'm mainly worrying about getting the problems solved correctly, and will work on optimizing later.

I also decided to simplify troubleshooting and have a little fun, so I made a basic HTML document to house all the scripts.

### Day 19: December 19, 2020

I haven't ignored the 100 Days of Code, but my time was spent working on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), and you can see how I progressed [on my commits for that](https://github.com/GeoJunkie/advent-of-code-2020/commits/main).

When I got to Day 10, I hit a wall that took a while to get over. Eventually, I was able to break down the problem, and learn some new things along the way. Between December 12th (I was a little behind on the days) until this past Thursday (December 17th), I spent at least an hour a day trying to work through the solution.

Finally I was able to get there and ended up learning a lot. [This article](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/) and [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYquumk4nWw) gave me the inspiration and information I needed to break down the problem and get it solved!

Since I have now been officially selected for a Developer Apprenticeship at Automattic, I'm shifting my focus away from the advent calendar puzzles to learning things I need to know for the work I'll be doing with WooCommerce.com. I'm picking up where I left off on learning full-stack JavaScript, followed by a course on React. 

Yesterday and today I worked through AJAX Basics. I worked with AJAX before, but it's been about 3 years so it was good to get a refresh on it (plus I was using jQuery back then, and won't be using it in the future).
