# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first day of my [Advent of Code calendar](https://adventofcode.com/)

**Thoughts**: I'm using JavaScript to hone my skills. At the same time, I'm working through the Full Stack JavaScript track at Team Treehouse, which will take up all of my other coding hours for a while :)

### Day 2: December 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the second day of my [Advent of Code calendar](https://adventofcode.com/)

**Thoughts**: I ran into trouble with part 2, because I failed to read the problem correctly. After spending a while agonizing over traces, data, and console.log entries, I started asking folks for ideas. Just describing the problem let me break my train of thought long enough to realize that I had read part of the description as a range of positions, but it was actually just two positions.

Careful understanding of the problem: the first step to solving it!

### Day 3: December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the third day of my [Advent of Code calendar](https://adventofcode.com/)

**Thoughts**: This one was fun. Mainly just a brute force loop through a list. For this, I'm mainly worrying about getting the problems solved correctly, and will work on optimizing later.

I also decided to simplify troubleshooting and have a little fun, so I made a basic HTML document to house all the scripts.
